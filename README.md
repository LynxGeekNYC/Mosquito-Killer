# Mosquito-Killer

Arduino script to create a mosquito detection system with LIDAR and a laser. This script integrates a LIDAR sensor, controls stepper motors for targeting, and activates a laser module for elimination. It's a basic framework to build upon and assumes hardware connections are correctly established.

# Hardware Requirements

- LIDAR sensor (e.g., Garmin LIDAR-Lite v3).
- 2 stepper motors (for pan and tilt).
- High-powered laser module with relay or MOSFET for control.
- Arduino Uno or similar.
- Stepper motor drivers (e.g., A4988 or L298N).
