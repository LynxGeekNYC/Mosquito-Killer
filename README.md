# Mosquito-Killer

Arduino script to create a mosquito detection system with LIDAR and a laser. This script integrates a LIDAR sensor, controls stepper motors for targeting, and activates a laser module for elimination. It's a basic framework to build upon and assumes hardware connections are correctly established.

# Hardware Requirements

- LIDAR sensor (e.g., Garmin LIDAR-Lite v3). - https://amzn.to/41Jxnxs
- 2 stepper motors (for pan and tilt). - https://amzn.to/49QqbSh
- High-powered laser module with relay or MOSFET for control. - https://amzn.to/3VPHJs0
- Arduino Uno or similar. - https://amzn.to/4frW4Sl
- Stepper motor drivers (e.g., A4988 or L298N).
